# Chat Session Summary - Tree Size App Optimization

## Problem Identified
The Tree Size app experienced a **maximum call stack size bug** when handling very large directory trees. The Tauri webview could not handle rendering the entire tree structure at once, causing the application to crash.

## Solution Approach
Implemented a **lazy-loading architecture** with the following key components:
1. **Depth-limited initial scan**: Only load the root directory and its immediate children (depth 1)
2. **On-demand loading**: Load subdirectories only when a user expands them
3. **Global cache system**: Store scan results in Rust to avoid unnecessary rescanning

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Rust) Changes:
1. Added a **global cache** using `lazy_static` to store scan results between requests
2. Created a `ScanCache` structure to hold the full scan data
3. Modified `scan_directory_complete` to store results in the global cache
4. Implemented a depth-limited tree builder function to return only specific levels
5. Created `get_directory_children` command to fetch children from the cache
6. Added `clear_scan_cache` command to free memory when needed

### Frontend (React) Changes:
1. Removed smart expand functionality that auto-expanded the tree
2. Implemented on-demand loading of directory contents
3. Added loading indicators to show when children are being loaded
4. Implemented error handling for cache misses with automatic recovery
5. Added cache clearing when unmounting or changing directories

## Benefits
- **Resolved call stack issue**: By only rendering what's needed
- **Improved performance**: No need to rescan directories when expanding nodes
- **Better memory usage**: Smaller payload sent to the frontend initially
- **Efficient caching**: Reuses already scanned data
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Automatically rescans if cache is lost

## Testing and Edge Cases
- Added proper error handling for cache misses
- Implemented cache clearing on component unmount
- Handled edge cases when paths don't exist in cache
- Added recovery mechanism to rescan if necessary

The implementation successfully addresses the maximum call stack size issue while providing a better user experience with faster navigation of large directory structures.
