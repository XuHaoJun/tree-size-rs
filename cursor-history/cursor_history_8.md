# File Owner Information Implementation

In this session, we implemented file owner information support throughout the application. This feature allows users to see who owns each file and directory in the tree view.

## Changes Made:

1. **Platform-Specific Owner Name Implementation**:
   - Added `owner_name: Option<String>` to the `PathInfo` struct in `platform.rs`
   - Implemented Unix owner retrieval using the `users` crate which maps UIDs to usernames
   - Implemented Windows owner retrieval using WinAPI (GetNamedSecurityInfoW, LookupAccountSidW)
   - Added fallback implementation for other platforms

2. **Updated Cargo Dependencies**:
   - Added `users = "0.11"` for Unix platforms
   - Extended winapi to include security features: `winapi = { version = "0.3", features = ["winnt", "securitybaseapi", "accctrl", "aclapi", "sddl"] }`

3. **Data Structure Integration**:
   - Added `owner_name` to `FileSystemEntry` struct
   - Added `owner_name` to `FileSystemTreeNode` struct
   - Added `owner_name` to `AnalyticsInfo` struct
   - Updated `analytics_map_to_entries` and tree building functions to preserve owner information

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Updated TypeScript `FileSystemTreeNode` interface to include `owner_name: string | null`
   - Modified `convertTreeNodeToTreeViewItem` to display owner information: `owner: node.owner_name || "Unknown"`
   - Owner name now appears as a column in the directory tree view

5. **Unit Testing**:
   - Added `test_owner_name_unix` to verify Unix owner detection
   - Added `test_owner_name_windows` to verify Windows owner detection
   - Tests verify both direct path info and end-to-end analytics propagation

## Design Considerations:

- Used `Option<String>` for owner name since it might not be available in some cases:
  - Permission issues
  - Missing users
  - Special filesystems
  - Platform limitations

- The implementation handles cross-platform compatibility while providing platform-specific optimizations.

## Windows Owner Name Fix:

The initial Windows implementation had a limitation where it only accepted `SidTypeUser` as a valid owner type. However, Windows files can be owned by various security principal types. The fix involved:

1. **Extended SID Type Support**:
   - Added support for multiple SID types:
     - `SidTypeUser` (1): Regular user accounts
     - `SidTypeWellKnownGroup` (2): Built-in groups like "Administrators"
     - `SidTypeAlias` (4): Local group accounts
     - `SidTypeDeletedAccount` (6): Deleted accounts

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error logging at each potential failure point
   - Added specific handling for deleted accounts
   - Better error messages for debugging ownership issues

3. **Key Code Changes**:
   ```rust
   match sid_type {
     t if t == SidTypeUser || t == SidTypeWellKnownGroup || t == SidTypeAlias => {
       // Accept users, well-known groups, and local groups as valid owners
       // Convert name and return
     }
     t if t == SidTypeDeletedAccount => {
       Some("<deleted account>".to_string())
     }
     _ => {
       eprintln!("Unsupported SID type: {}", sid_type);
       None
     }
   }
   ```

This fix ensures proper owner name resolution on Windows, handling the full range of possible file owners in the Windows security model.
