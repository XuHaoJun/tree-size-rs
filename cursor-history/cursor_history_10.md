# Virtual Directory Implementation Session

## What we accomplished:

1. Implemented the virtual directory functionality in `build_tree_from_entries_with_depth` to create a special node that aggregates all direct file children of a directory (excluding subdirectories)

2. Enhanced the virtual directory naming:
   - Changed from generic "Files" to parent-specific names like "[5 Files]"
   - Created paths for virtual directories that reflect their relationship to parent directories

3. Added robust checks for empty directories to avoid creating unnecessary virtual nodes

4. Refactored code:
   - Extracted the indices building code into a separate `build_indices` function
   - Added `build_virtual_directory_node` parameter to control virtual directory creation

5. Extended the virtual directory functionality to the optimized `build_tree_from_indices` function:
   - Implemented parallel processing of files vs. directories
   - Ensured consistency between both tree-building implementations

This implementation helps visualize the space used by files directly in a directory versus space used by subdirectories, making it easier for users to understand their storage usage patterns.
