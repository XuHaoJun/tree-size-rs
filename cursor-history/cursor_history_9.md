# Refactoring AtomicU64 to u64 in tree-size-rs

## Summary
In this session, we refactored the tree-size-rs Rust application to replace `AtomicU64` with regular `u64` types. The code was using atomic operations for counting directory entries, files, and sizes, but these were unnecessary given the program's algorithm structure.

## Discussion Points
- Initially discussed whether `AtomicU64` was necessary for thread safety
- Identified that the code uses a depth-first approach where each directory's data is only updated after its children are processed
- Determined that regular `u64` would be sufficient since there are no concurrent modifications to the same counter
- Verified that `DashMap` is still necessary for thread-safe access to different entries in the map

## Changes Made
1. Changed all `AtomicU64` fields to regular `u64` in the `AnalyticsInfo` struct
2. Removed all atomic operations (`.load(Ordering::Relaxed)` and `.store()` calls)
3. Updated the directory update logic to use `DashMap::get_mut()` and `Arc::make_mut()` 
4. Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to the `AnalyticsInfo` struct to fix a compiler error with `Arc::make_mut()`

## Benefits
- Simpler code without atomic operations
- Better performance by avoiding atomic operation overhead
- Maintained thread safety through proper design and use of concurrent collections
