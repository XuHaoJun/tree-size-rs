# TreeSize-rs Chat Session Summary

## Modifications to Disk Space Analysis Tool

### 1. Return Both Apparent Size and Allocated Size

- Modified platform.rs to always return both apparent size and allocated size
- Removed the `use_apparent_size` parameter, which previously made the function return only one type of size
- Updated function signatures to return both size metrics simultaneously
- Ensured proper handling of both size types on Windows and Unix platforms

### 2. Counting Allocated Size in Directory Hierarchies

- Added initialization of `size_allocated_bytes` in the AnalyticsInfo struct
- Implemented tracking of allocated size in parallel directory scanning
- Updated directory size calculations to account for both apparent and allocated sizes
- Ensured proper aggregation of allocated sizes up the directory tree

### 3. Refactoring Size Field Names for Consistency

- Renamed fields from `size` to `size_bytes` and `size_allocated` to `size_allocated_bytes`
- Updated all references to these fields throughout the codebase
- Created consistent naming pattern across platform-specific and UI components

### 4. UI Implementation of Allocated Size Column

- Added "Allocated" column to the TreeSizeView component
- Updated grid layout to accommodate the new column
- Ensured proper display and formatting of allocated size values
- Fixed grid columns in both rows and headers

## Purpose

These changes enable users to see both the apparent size (logical file size) and allocated size (actual disk space used) separately. This is particularly useful for:

- Identifying compression efficiency
- Finding sparse files
- Understanding actual disk usage versus logical file sizes
- Better analysis of storage patterns

The UI now clearly displays both metrics side by side for easy comparison.
