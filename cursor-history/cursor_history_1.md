# Tree-Size-RS Development History

## Initial File and Directory Count Implementation

- Added `file_count` and `directory_count` fields to the `AnalyticsInfo` struct
- Updated the constructor to initialize these counts based on entry type
- Modified the `update_analytics` function to properly track files vs. directories
- Ensured proper atomic operations for count updates

## Frontend Interface Updates

- Updated the `FileSystemEntry` TypeScript interface to include new count fields
- Modified the `buildTreeData` function to utilize actual file and directory counts
- Improved tree structure to properly display the hierarchy of files and folders

## Enhanced UI Display

- Added columns for file and folder counts in the `TreeSizeView` component
- Updated the rendering logic to show counts in a structured table layout
- Improved visual hierarchy with proper spacing and alignment

## Disk Space Information Implementation

- Created a `get_space_info` function in the Rust backend
- Added support for retrieving total, used, and available disk space
- Implemented cross-platform functionality for both Unix and Windows

## Tauri Command Integration

- Exposed `get_free_space` and `get_space_info` as Tauri commands
- Updated the invoke handler to include the new commands
- Ensured proper error handling and result formatting

## Frontend Status Bar Enhancement

- Added disk space visualization to the `DirectoryScanner` component
- Implemented the `updateDiskSpace` function to fetch and display space information
- Created a progress bar to show disk usage percentage

## Fixes and Optimizations

- Fixed linter errors related to event listener type definitions
- Resolved issues with `UnlistenFn` type imports
- Addressed edge cases in disk space calculation

## SysInfo Integration

- Replaced standard library disk space functions with the `sysinfo` crate
- Improved cross-platform compatibility for disk information retrieval
- Added better error handling for cases where disk information is unavailable
- Fixed API compatibility issues with the latest version of the `sysinfo` crate

## Windows Path Handling Improvements

- Fixed display issues with Windows paths that showed incorrect hierarchy
- Added path normalization utilities to handle Windows-specific path formats:
  - Created `normalizePath()` function to remove `\\?\` prefix from Windows long paths
  - Added `getParentPath()` function for cross-platform parent path extraction
- Enhanced the `buildTreeData` function to properly handle Windows path separators
- Updated UI path displays to normalize paths for consistent presentation
- Fixed search/filter functionality to work with normalized paths
- Improved directory selection to reset previous data when changing directories
