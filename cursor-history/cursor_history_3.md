# Directory Size Calculator Optimization Session

## Summary
In this session, we optimized a Rust directory size analyzer by learning from "dust" (a popular disk usage analyzer) and fixed several critical bugs. The optimizations focused on performance, correctness, and robustness.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Implemented batch processing of directory entries to limit concurrent tasks
- Added pre-allocation for collections to reduce memory reallocations
- Optimized parent directory chain calculations with early stopping
- Used `Box::pin` for recursive async calls to improve future handling

### 2. Fixed Threading Issues
- Resolved "future cannot be sent between threads safely" error
- Initially tried `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` approach
- Later simplified to direct sequential processing to eliminate threading issues
- Improved error handling for file processing errors

### 3. Fixed Symlink Handling
- Corrected symlink counting logic that was causing test failures
- Ensured symlinks count as entries but not as files or directories
- Added explicit handling for symlinks to prevent double-counting
- Updated parent directory updates to properly handle symlinks

### 4. Boundary Protection
- Fixed potential path traversal issue in parent chain calculations
- Added target directory boundary checks to `get_parent_chain_sync`
- Prevented processing of directories outside the target scanning area
- Improved function signature to accept and respect target directory bounds

### 5. Memory Management
- Reduced memory usage with more efficient data structures
- Improved cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks 
- Used atomic operations more efficiently for counter updates

## Testing
- Resolved failing test case `test_calculate_size_with_symlink`
- Ensured proper counting of files, directories, and symlinks

## Discussion Points
- Considered converting `get_parent_chain_sync` to async but determined it wasn't beneficial
- Explored parallelization strategies from the dust codebase
- Debated memory vs. speed tradeoffs in various optimization approaches

The final implementation is more robust, correctly handles edge cases, and follows patterns from established tools in the Rust ecosystem.
